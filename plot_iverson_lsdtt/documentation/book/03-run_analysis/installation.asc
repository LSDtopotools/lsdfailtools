== Installation

All the code has been developed, tested and ran on `UNIX` platform. It requires uses of a {cpp} compiler and a `python 3` environment.

=== The code

The code has been developed within the open-source [LSDTopoTools]https://lsdtopotools.github.io/ research software suite. *Add here how to get the code*. The {Cpp} code is constituted of 11 files requiring compilation into an executable to be used. The `python` code is distributed as a package that can be easily installed with a python packaged manager (e.g., `pip`).

=== Compiling the model

The {cpp} code requires compilation into an executable before use. This can be done with the `GNU g++` compiler, installed in most `UNIX` and `IOS` distributions. The `Analysis_driver` folder in the root folder contains a `make` file that automates the compilation. It can be simply ran as follow:

[source,console]
----
make -f iverson_model.make
----

It generates an executable file named `iverson_model.exe` in the same folder and is ready to be used.

=== Installing the `python` package

The `python` package can be installed in any `python` environment satisfying the following dependencies: `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `pytables` and `matplotlib`. The package is downloaded with the `github` repository in the folder `python_tools` and can be installed in the `python` environment using `pip install .` in the `python_tools folder`.

==== Optional: Getting a python environment with conda

If it is required to install a `python` environment from scratch, `miniconda` environment manager is an easy free and open-source solution. It can be downloaded from [here]https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/. Choose any `python 3` installer compatible with your operating system. Once installed it offers a clean method to manage different `python` environments with different combinations of packages installed. Once install, run the following command to create an environment:

[source,console]
----
conda create -n iverson_python
----

This creates a `python` environment named `iverson_python` that need to be activate at each boot of a terminal using the python plotting tools using:

[source,console]
----
conda activate iverson_python
----

The environment has been successfully activated if `(iverson_python)` is stated at the beginning of the command line. After the first activation, the dependencies can be installed with:

[source,console]
----
conda install -c conda-forge numpy scipy pandas pytables matplotlib
----

This only need to be run once. All installed packages will remain available at the reactivation of the environment.
