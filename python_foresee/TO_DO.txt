FORESEE - TO DO: 
20/08/2020
- clear up git history on the LSDfailtools account --> DONE
- edit README file on LSDfailtools account 
- update .gitignore document --> DONE
- delete and check duplicate file_with_paths.json
- check to_do docucument by Guillaume
- change dates formatting in the code to be customisable
- check what the print statements mean in the calibration process
- think of a way to speed up calibration-could this be parallelised? (currently takes 48hrs to do the full calibration)
- remove bits of commented code at the end of the different scripts
- check how sentinel_combo is different from the All_ files created by interferometry scripts
- sentinel interferometry script seems to have nothing to do with the sentinel files, it only deals with the interferometry files. 
-check what the sentinel files and the interferometry files actually contain exactly
- check thresholds in the sentinel scripts - it only takes 1 threshold. Why? 
- remove unnecessary plotting parts in the InSAR processing
- prefailarr has disappeared from the calibration and validation files. Why do we not need that now?
- check what function files are the same 
- make a transferable anaconda file with all the packages to install
- create a requirements.txt file specifying all dependencies and versions
