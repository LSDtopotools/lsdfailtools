TO DO:
- Finish running the Calibration and validation with the new output Erli needs (Factor of safety and depths)
    - Need to fix the code, because the outputs are not what we expect
- Create polygons from the points we have from the validation using Voronoi tessellation.
    - Need to convert the numpy array of points (X,Y positions) into a geodataframe with lat, lon
    and then convert this into a shapefile.

Include weather predictions in the precipitation data. i.e. extend the time series into the future.
- Make python script that takes in all the info we need in order to run the code from the docker
container.
- Have a calibrated and a non-calibrated version of the code so that we can give that to
Telespazio and they don't need to rerun the code.
- Documentation
- Sort out GitHub Repo
- Tidy output directories and usability of the code.
